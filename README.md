# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains a Python-based credit card fraud detection project. The goal of this project is to build a model that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions from a dataset containing both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

## Overview

Credit card fraud is a significant problem that can result in substantial financial losses for both individuals and financial institutions. Machine learning techniques are commonly used to detect fraudulent transactions based on patterns and anomalies in transaction data.

In this project, we explore the use of different machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to detect fraudulent transactions. We evaluate each algorithm's performance and select the best-performing model for the task.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available in the 'creditcard.csv' file. It contains features such as transaction time, transaction amount, and anonymized features (V1, V2, V3, ... V28), as well as a binary 'Class' column indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

The dataset consists of 284,807 transactions, with a highly imbalanced class distribution: the majority of transactions are legitimate, while only a small fraction are fraudulent.

## Data Preprocessing

Before training the machine learning models, we perform several data preprocessing steps, including:
- Handling missing data (none in this dataset)
- Scaling the 'Amount' column using StandardScaler
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)

## Model Building

We build and evaluate the following machine learning models:
- Logistic Regression
- XGBoost
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

We assess each model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score. The best-performing model is selected for fraud detection.

## Results

Here are the results of the model evaluations:

- Logistic Regression:
  - Accuracy: 94.15%
  - F1-score: 3.75%
  - ROC-AUC: 91.78%

- XGBoost:
  - Accuracy: 99.93%
  - F1-score: 78.26%
  - ROC-AUC: 96.33%

- Decision Tree:
  - Accuracy: 99.88%
  - F1-score: 61.54%
  - ROC-AUC: 92.18%

- Random Forest:
  - Accuracy: 99.89%
  - F1-score: 67.39%
  - ROC-AUC: 96.06%

The XGBoost model outperforms the others in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, making it the selected model for credit card fraud detection.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
```

2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the models.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models, particularly XGBoost, in detecting credit card fraud. The selected model can be further fine-tuned and deployed in real-world financial systems to help prevent fraudulent transactions.
